		 <h2>Computer</h2>
		 
		 <a href="file:///C:/Users/uae1/Desktop/Facebook/Bookmark.html">go to menu </a>
		 <p> A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
		     The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a program, make computers very flexible and useful.
			 Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices</p>
	
	
	
	<h4> CPU</h4>
	   <p> Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor,
	   the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the Central Processing Unit of the computer.
	   A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.</p>
	   
	   <h4> ALU </h4>
	   <p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs
	   arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU),
	   which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits,
	   including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs).
	   A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.</p>
	   
	   <h2> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES </h2>
	   <p>A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. 
	      The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages,
		  such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal </p>
		  
		  <h4>C</h4>
		  <p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming,
		  lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
		  By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions,
		  and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language,
		  including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
		  
		  <h4>C + +</h4>
		  <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language
		  for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.</p>
		  
		  <h2>DBMS</h2>
		  <p>A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases.
		  The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.</p>
		  
		  <h4>RDBMS</h4>
		  <p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database.
		  Most commercial RDBMS's use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database,
		  although SQL was invented after the development of the relational model and is not necessary for its use.</p>
		  
		  <h4>OODBMS</h4>
		  <p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects.
		  OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.
		  Most of the object databases also offer some kind of query language, permitting objects to be found through a declarative programming approach.
          Also called an object database management system (ODMS</p>
		  
		  <h4>HDBMS</h4>
		  <p>HDBMS stands for Hierarchical Data Base Management System</p>
		  
		  <h4>NWDBMS</h4>
		  <p>The acronym NWDBMS has a life path number 3. The life path number three implies that you posses numerous abilities
		     and have a positive nature with an awesome readiness to learn.</p>
